[160. 相交链表](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/intersection-of-two-linked-lists/)

### Solution One: Double Pointer
1. Assume there are a nodes in headA, b nodes in headB, and c nodes in common part of both link list
2. Then before the joint node, there are a-c nodes in headA, b-c nodes in headB
3. Pointer A from headA traverse the link list, then traverse headB; B from headB then headA; both stop at the joint node
4. When the two pointers meet, they moved (a + b - c) nodes and (b + a - c) nodes
5. So they acutually moved same number of nodes. At this time, the meeting node is the joint node(or Null)

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def getIntersectionNode(self, headA: ListNode, headB: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        A, B = headA, headB
        while A != B:
            A = A.next if A else headB
            B = B.next if B else headA
        return A
```
