[19. 删除链表的倒数第N个节点](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/remove-nth-node-from-end-of-list/)

### Solution One: Double pointers
1. Set a pointer p1 points to head, and another pointer p2 points to the node before head.
2. First p1 moves forward n steps and stop.
3. Then p1 and p2 together move forward until p1 points to the last node of the list.
4. Now p2 is pointing to the node before the nth node from the end
5. p2.next = p2.next.next

```
# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, next=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.next = next
class Solution:
    def removeNthFromEnd(self, head: ListNode, n: int) -> ListNode:
        dummy = ListNode(0, head)
        first = head
        second = dummy
        for i in range(n):
            first = first.next

        while first:
            first = first.next
            second = second.next
        
        second.next = second.next.next
        return dummy.next
```
