[142. 环形链表Ⅱ](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/linked-list-cycle-ii/)

### Solution One: Double Pointers
Set a fast pointer and a slow pointer, both started at head
</br>Assume there are t nodes before circle and b nodes in circle
</br>Fast pointer takes two step one time and slow takes one
1. The first time two pointers meet:
</br> If slow pointer moved s steps, then fast took: f = s + nb steps.
</br> This is because fast pointer must have taken n more circles than slow pointer.
</br> Or fast pointer took two times slow pointer pointer's steps, f = 2s.
</br> This means f = 2nb, s = nb, so they both take steps times circle size b.
</br> So move t more steps they will be at the entry of the circle.
2. Now move fast pointer back to head and slow pointer stayed put:
</br> Both pointers will move one step one time
</br> When they meet again, they both took t steps and meet at the entry of the circle

class Solution:
    def detectCycle(self, head: ListNode) -> ListNode:
        slow, fast = head, head
        while True:
            if not fast or not fast.next: 
                return None
            slow = slow.next
            fast = fast.next.next
            if slow == fast:
                break
        fast = head
        while slow != fast:
            fast = fast.next
            slow = slow.next
        return slow
