[104. 二叉树的最大深度](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/maximum-depth-of-binary-tree/)&ensp;*[easy]*

### Solution One: DFS
1. We can solve this problem by Depth First Search and recursion
2. First check if root is None. It yes, return 0
3. Else we can find the tree's left child tree and right child tree's max depth
4. Recursively call the method until we find the deepest leaf node, who doesn't have children tree.

```
# Definition for a binary tree node.
# class TreeNode:
#     def __init__(self, val=0, left=None, right=None):
#         self.val = val
#         self.left = left
#         self.right = right
class Solution:
    def maxDepth(self, root):
        if root is None: 
            return 0 
        else: 
            left_height = self.maxDepth(root.left) 
            right_height = self.maxDepth(root.right) 
            return max(left_height, right_height) + 1 

```
