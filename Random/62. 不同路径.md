### Solution One: Mathematical
Permutation and combination formula: C(m+n-2, n-1)
```
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        return math.comb(m+n, m-1)
```


### Solution Two: Dynamic Programming
1. The only two grids that can reach to the current grid: the top or the left
2. So the ways to get to the current grid includes the ways to get its top and its left 
3. That's dp[i][j] = dp[]

```
class Solution:
    def uniquePaths(self, m: int, n: int) -> int:
        dp = [[0]*n for _ in range(m)]
        for i in range(m):
            for j in range(n):
                if i == 0 or j == 0:
                    dp[i][j] = 1
                else:
                    dp[i][j] = dp[i-1][j] + dp[i][j-1]
        return dp[-1][-1]
```
