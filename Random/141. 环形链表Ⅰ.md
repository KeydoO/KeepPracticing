[141. 环形链表Ⅰ](https://leetcode-cn.com/problems/linked-list-cycle/)&ensp;*[easy]*

### Solution One: Double Pointers
1. Set two pointers fast and slow
2. Fast moves forward two steps each round and slow moves one
3. If fast ever meets slow again, then there must be a circle in the link list.

# Definition for singly-linked list.
# class ListNode:
#     def __init__(self, x):
#         self.val = x
#         self.next = None

class Solution:
    def hasCycle(self, head: Optional[ListNode]) -> bool:
        fast = head
        slow = head
        while True:
            if not fast or not fast.next:
                return False
            fast = fast.next.next
            slow = slow.next
            if slow == fast:
                return True
```
